This causes inflammation and leads to various symptoms that can range from being mild to quite severe.The symptoms of allergy vary such as mild sneezing, runny nose, swelling of face, swelling of the tongue, skin rash, itching, and difficulty in breathing, etc. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction to any type of allergy which can be life-threatening, if not promptly treated.Allergies are widely prevalent across the world.

        "Overview": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive disorder of the brain that fades away memory. It is characterized by disturbances in thinking skills, reasoning, language, and perception and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple daily tasks.The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not known. However, accumulation of amyloid proteins and tangled bundles of fibers called neurofibrillary, or tau tangles, in the brain are suspected to play a role.Alzheimer\u2019s disease is not a normal part of aging and is not something that inevitably happens in later life. However, the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease increases substantially with advancing age. A combination of age-related brain changes, genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors are thought to increase the risk of this condition.Though AD is not entirely preventable, ensuring an extensive social network, and frequent participation in social, physical, and intellectually stimulating activities like reading, playing games, participating in adult education courses, and other recreational activities can delay its onset.Current Alzheimer's medications can help temporarily with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes. Caregivers play an extremely pivotal role in helping the patient with their daily needs and activities as well as protecting them from any danger.",
